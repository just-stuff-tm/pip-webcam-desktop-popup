Key Changes for Edge-Triggered Menu:
Trigger Zone:
Added #triggerZone, a 20px-wide invisible vertical strip along the left edge of the screen.

Styled with position: fixed, width: 20px, and high z-index to ensure itâ€™s always detectable.

No visible button; the menu triggers purely by mouse movement.

Menu Behavior:
#menu remains hidden at left: -250px until the mouse enters #triggerZone.

mouseenter on #triggerZone adds the .open class, sliding the menu in.

mouseleave on #menu removes .open, sliding it back out when the mouse leaves the menu area.

Smooth animation with transition: left 0.3s ease.

Removed Menu Toggle Button:
The #menuToggle button is gone, replaced by the edge-trigger mechanism.

Video and Layout:
Video container still fills the window with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
